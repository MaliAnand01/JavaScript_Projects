[build]
  # 'publish' specifies the directory containing your deployable frontend assets.
  # Since your index.html, style.css, and script.js are in the root, we use "."

  # 'command' is the build command Netlify will run.

  # if you had frontend dependencies, but for this project, it's not strictly needed.
